# QAnon and The Radicalization of Nationalists Using Conspiracy Theories

## Premise

The rise of radical right wing conspiracy theories has coincided with the political upheaval the United States has experienced since 2015. Crazy conspiracy theories around the Clinton family, massive child sex trafficking rings, the "Deep State", Fusion GPS, PizzaGate, and QAnon seemingly came out of nowhere and into the collective consciousness of American society over the last half decade. The Open Propaganda Project team wanted to understand who is driving these radical conspiracy theories, how much influence they have on Twitter, and 


## Data Extraction

The Open Propaganda Framework team extracted 49,364 accounts that met the following criteria:

* The account is not suspended.
* The account has at least one point in the "radical_conspiracy" classification. 


## Analyzing QAnon Support Broadly

The makeup of these 49,364 accounts is interesting, as it shows that there is a large audience for radical conspiracy theories in the United States and abroad. Roughly 5000 of these accounts (10%) have shared more than 50 pieces of content related to radical conspiracy theories such as QAnon, which denotes some level of identity tied to these conspiracy theories. The other 44,000 accounts can be considered "aware/supportive" of these conspiracy theories, as they have shared radical conspiracy content, however they are mixed in with normal non-political tweets. There is strong overlap between supporting Donald Trump and sharing radical conspiracy theories, as the below graph shows. There is also strong overlap between "radical_platform_migration" and "radical_conspiracy", as the intent seems to be to get users off Twitter and onto less-regulated social media bubbles. Quite a few of these accounts try to get users to Gab, 8Chan, and other highly radicalized services.

Only 2833 of the accounts are flagged "likely_automated", which is interesting as it shows that these conspiracy theories have grassroots support and do not need a strong amplification base. This is also interesting, since a larger percentage of these accounts have geotags enabled compared to other sample sets in our data dump. See below for the geotagged locations of Radical Conspiracy accounts - most of these should represent real people in the United States. The interesting part is how this map seems to align with this map of mass shootings from [this Vox article](https://www.vox.com/a/mass-shootings-america-sandy-hook-gun-violence).

One of the more influential accounts is inthematrixxx, which is tied to inthematrixxx.com - a US-hosted website that is a major hub for QAnon and other radical conspiracy theories. The web host for inthematrixxx.com is based out of Bulgaria and seems largely defunct (GetClouder/Kyup), but the Bulgarian owner is still active in the tech community. It was originally registered in the Virgin Islands, which is a common pattern for Russian Intelligence based operations. 

## QAnon and Illegal Charities

One interesting case came up as The Open Propaganda Framework team was analyzing this data: The US Freedom Army. They are one of the top sharers of radicalized conspiracy content according to the model, as they share the hashtag #usfreedomarmy with the QAnon community. The US Freedom Army is a registered 501(3)(c) non-profit organization registered in Colorado (EIN:82-3366538). They share political content exclusively to promote radical right viewpoints, pro-Trump messaging, defamatory content against Democrats, and occasionally dabble in radical right conspiracy theories. The organization sells "US Freedom Army" branded merchandise, but otherwise uses their revenue to prop up their social media presence. This non-profit is acting illegally per the IRS rules around 501(3)(c) non-profit organizations in such that they are actively supporting political campaigns using non-profit funds. The odd part is that this non-profit is run by an elderly man in Colorado, however the account has extremely high post and like rates on Twitter - not unlike the numbers we see in the likely_automated bot category.

Another more prominent operating charity - Project Veritas - is also a major influencer in the Radical Conspiracy (notably, QAnon) conversation on Twitter. They play a very fine line as a 501(3)(c) dedicated to "exposing censorship by big tech companies", as they use their Twitter account to push a lot of radical right wing conspiracy theories. They also use their position of influence to advocate for Donald Trump's campaign, which may be a bit more flagrant of their tax-exempt status. 

Unfortunately this appears to be two of many for-profit and non-profit organizations that are working to spread misinformation for potential personal gain. 

## QAnon Support and Russian Media

Nearly a third of the QAnon accounts in this dataset (17618 accounts) have a recent tweet to Russian state sponsored media sources. On average they only share one to two links that are tied back to Russia Today and others (out of their last 200-1000 tweets each), but that is an alarming overlap between QAnon support and implicit trust with Russian media sources. 

The two top examples of this QAnon and Russian Media connection can be seen in the Twitter profiles of 13patrickfields and AaronRay3355. Both accounts are relatively unknown - with a combined follower base of less than 4000 users - however they both share Russian-aligned conspiracy theories at an alarming rate. 13patrickfields is also a great example of how YouTube in particular has been weaponized to share dangerous conspiracy content at a rate never seen before.
